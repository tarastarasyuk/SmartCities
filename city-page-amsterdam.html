                <p> In Amsterdam, the government and business are actively building joint models in which everyone has
                    The product has a second life - plastic bottles turn into street stalls, rain
                    water into beer, and old houses into sources of metal for tools.
                </p>

                <p> Amsterdam got its name from the name of the river Amstel and the word "ladies", which means
                    means - "dam". From a small fishing village, which Amsterdam was in the XII century,
                    the city became one of the most important ports in the world and a major trading center. IN
                    Amsterdam is home to about 50% of the turnover of light industry in the Netherlands,
                    located enterprises of industry and mechanical engineering, engaged in the city
                    cutting and trade in diamonds, tourism is very active.

                </p>

                <p> At the same time, Amsterdam is a very compact city. Its area is 219.5 square meters. km and density
                    population - 4 457 people per square kilometer. For comparison, the area of ​​Lviv is close
                    192 sq. km, and a population density of 3,793 people per square kilometer. Amsterdam is possible
                    ride a bike in just a quarter of an hour. And its residents appreciate this
                    mobility, the ability to get to any object quickly and easily.

                </p>

                <p>
                    But the city is growing. One of the main challenges facing Amsterdam is this
                    growth of about 12 thousand people a year. Now the city is home to more than 825 thousand.
                    man. The challenge of urbanization is now felt by almost all cities in the world, and the World
                    economic forum predicts that by 2050, 68% of the world's population will live in
                    cities.

                </p>

                <p> To meet this challenge, Amsterdam will have to build 50,000 houses before
                    2025. And to ensure sustainable development, it is important to look for new solutions
                    in the area of ​​a smart city, a new way of thinking of its inhabitants is needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growth leads to new problems: the bigger the city, the more difficult the issue
                    mobility and even more so it will produce garbage. If you already have problems with
                    garbage (not only in Lviv similar problems), what will happen in a few decades,
                    when will the city double? To implement the strategy of a smart city in Amsterdam
                    There are more than 6,600 startups, corporations and other participants.

                <p> Traditional (linear) economy uses the following approach to resources: creating,
                    use and disposal of waste. As a result, we have landfills thrown away
                    on a battery dump and garbage islands in the oceans.

                </p>

                <p> In the Netherlands, at the state level, there is a strategic goal: to become a country by 2050
                    closed cycle economy. Companies, citizens and institutes know about it. All
                    working to create a new economic system in the country.

                <p> In the Netherlands, at the state level, there is a strategic goal: to become a country by 2050
                    closed cycle economy. Companies, citizens and institutes know about it. All
                    working to create a new economic system in the country.

                </p>

                <p> Here's what the study showed. Most often they talk about household or household waste.
                    But in Amsterdam it accounts for only 18% of all waste and the remaining 82% is generated
                    companies and the industrial sector. That's why it was important to work with companies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The city has begun looking for business models that can help the closed-loop economy. That
                    The study showed that the main garbage producers in the city are food producers
                    food and construction companies. How to combine these business models? They are capable
                    complement each other. For example, organic waste is used for
                    biogas production, as well as for the production of bioplastics. Products and services are a must
                    minimize waste, harmful emissions and other types of pollution.
                </p>

                <p> Orgaworld Greenmills uses anaerobic biogas to produce biogas
                    composting. Since 2010, the factory has processed 120 thousand tons of food waste. Their
                    collected in special tanks, inside which the anaerobic process takes place
                    fermentation - this work is helped by microorganisms. The result is biogas, which
                    then converted into steam, heat or energy. Part is used by the company itself, and
                    part of it goes to the grid. Residual products from this process become
                    high quality fertilizer.

                <h5> There are 800 festivals a year in the Netherlands. </h5>
                <p> They bring the country 700 million euros, and
                    they can be a place to test new approaches, new business models - where
                    still test them, if not in a place of concentration of tens of thousands of people? <br>
                    The DGTL Festival is held annually in Amsterdam. Its organizers are testing new ones
                    waste management solutions, and by 2020 DGTL wants to become the first festival with
                    closed-loop economy. </p>

                <h5> Garbage disposal </h5>
                <p> The Amsterdam authorities are promoting waste recycling and reprofiling projects.
                    But garbage incineration is also used to keep homes and restaurants warm
                    water: this is what AEB does, which uses its own technology to transform
                    various types of waste into energy or raw materials, while providing a low amount
                    emissions into the atmosphere. The company produces 1 million MW of electricity annually, which is
                    enough
                    to serve 320 thousand households, as well as 600 thousand GJ of heat for heating
                    tap water and home heating. </p>

                <p> Garbage is divided into several categories, organic waste is allocated separately, and large waste
                    is allocated separately
                    garbage such as furniture, which can then be used by students or those who have it
                    not enough money for a new one. The second life can be given to clothes, giving it to one of
                    local second-hand cars. There are separate points for different categories. For residents
                    Cities are free, and companies pay taxes. </p>

                <h5> De Ceuvel district on the Amsterdam promenade </h5>
                <p> The De Ceuvel district on Amsterdam's waterfront has decided to pursue sustainable development and
                    close a series of chains to create a closed-loop economy in isolation
                    locations.
                </p>
                <p> The boats are equipped with heat exchangers of supply and exhaust ventilation. Warm air that
                    leaves the room, returns. This saves electricity
                    and gas used in heating.
                </p>

                <h5> In Amsterdam, grass grows on the roofs of some houses </h5>
                <p> Such green roofs are needed
                    fertilizers containing nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. All these substances are in human urine.
                    Therefore, in
                    In 2014, Waternet, the sewer company in Amsterdam, launched
                    a project to collect urine for further processing and put urinals in the main square
                    cities. </p>

                <h5> PUMA Project </h5>
                <p>
                    As the city has to grow and develop, some buildings will have to be demolished someday. AND
                    in Amsterdam, houses contain tones of steel, copper, aluminum and lead. Steel - in high-altitude
                    buildings, copper - in cables, aluminum - in window frames, gold - in telephones.
                    The PUMA project (Prospecting the urban mines of Amsterdam) represents the city as
                    "Mine" for the extraction of metals. Scripts were written at Leiden University
                    mining in the city, and Delft University of Technology has developed a method of determination
                    metal content in buildings. To draw a map showing the presence of steel and copper in
                    buildings, researchers had to use existing datasets from companies as well
                    go around many houses on their own.
                </p>

                <h5> Clean City
                    Networks and Clean
                    Cap </h5>
                <p> Of course, like any other city that wants to be called smart, Amsterdam
                    uses many digital tools. For example, ultrasonic Clean sensors
                    Cap is installed on all garbage containers and bins to keep in real time
                    report their fullness. Such sensors are part of the cyanphysical system Clean City
                    Networks (CCN). This system is the optimal route for garbage collection
                    machines. </p>
                <h5> Felyx E-Scooter </h5>
                <p> You don't have to own something to enjoy it. This is especially true
                    transport. Awkward to ride a scooter in the subway? Use Samocat Sharing. Not
                    do you want to pay taxes and spend on car maintenance? For help
                    taxis and car-sharing services are coming.
                    One such project in Amsterdam is the Felyx E-Scooter. You need to download the application,
                    find the nearest electric scooter and start driving around the city. </p>
