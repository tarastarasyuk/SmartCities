                <p> Barcelona is one of the smartest cities, according to the study "Understanding the challenges and
                    opportunities of smart cities ", implemented by Philips Lighting and SmartCitesWorld. What does
                    Barcelona is particularly interesting? She has reinvented herself over the last 30 years. After the
                    era
                    production and trade in textiles, in the 1980s, stagnation and unemployment threatened
                    the city's industrial dream, and its economy almost declined. Then the Barcelona City Council
                    decided that
                    the only way to move forward is to transform the city's economy and social profile, and
                    also the promotion of a new economy based on areas of knowledge, modern tourism and quality
                    infrastructure for residents, investors and visitors. </p>

                <p> Technology has become an important tool for making Barcelona more comprehensive,
                    productive, self-sufficient, innovative and community-oriented. </p>

                <p> In the 2010s, Barcelona's strategy and focus on becoming smart began to take shape
                    the city. The city council began to consider the modernization process as a way to strengthen the
                    intellectual
                    brand of Barcelona and become a landmark for all other cities seeking to redirect their own
                    economy.
                </p>

    <section class="content strategy" id="strategy">
        <div class="container container-content">
            <div class="city-centered-title">
                <h1>Strategy</h1>
                <div class="split-element"></div>
            </div>
            <span>
                <p> In 2013, realizing the importance of a clear smart city strategy, the city council began work
                    to become the first truly smart city in Spain. In the process, they are
                    also formulated the following definition of a smart city: “a self-sufficient productive city
                    neighborhoods, inside the hyperconnected capital with zero emissions. "Barcelona aimed to
                    use new technologies and infrastructure to promote economic growth and
                    guarantee a higher quality of life for its citizens.
                </p>

                <p> Several local and regional stakeholders, such as business and universities, were involved in
                    defining and implementing this strategy. In a reflective note, we can say that cooperation with
                    others
                    public administrations and public-private partnerships
                    highly efficient. As for the "smart city of Barcelona" brand, the autonomous government of Catalonia
                    also supported many initiatives when it came to broader projects involving others
                    areas of the region. Cooperation with other cities in Spain, as well as support, was also important
                    Of the European Union.
                </p>

                <p> Returning to the report "Understanding the Challenges and Opportunities of Smart Cities", leadership
                    was highlighted
                    as one of the success factors in the development of a smart city. Local authorities and
                    professionals from 19 countries
                    noted the influence of "educated" leaders on the long-term vision of commitment to inclusion and
                    cooperation. In the case of Barcelona, ​​the exceptional importance of the smart city was further
                    emphasized
                    government directives. We can observe that although other participants also participated, the City
                    Council
                    provided clear guidance on strategies, programs and projects in the smart city building effort.
                    As a result of this insightful leadership and well-coordinated cooperation, Barcelona is today
                    is considered a smart city of world importance.
                </p>

                <p> In March 2014, the European Commission named Barcelona the European Capital of Innovation, or
                    ICapital. The award is given for the introduction of new technologies that help to stay
                    better connected with citizens. This recognition, in turn, helped make Barcelona
                    "Mobile world capital" until 2023, which led to the fact that Barcelona became a place
                    holding the World Mobile Congress. </p>

                <p>
                    Barcelona, ​​as a smart city, has achieved a wide range of benefits through investment in the
                    Internet
                    things - IoT for urban systems. Improvement of high technologies observed throughout
                    Barcelona is a good example for other cities looking to improve their technology
                    infrastructure in similar ways. Some of them are listed below:

    <section class="content strategy" id="projects">
        <div class="container container-content">
            <div class="city-centered-title">
                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <div class="split-element"></div>
            </div>
            <span>
                <h5> Street light </h5>
                <p> An LED-based lighting system has helped Barcelona become
                    more energy efficient, which saves money for the city. With the help of sensors system
                    also receives information on pollution, humidity, temperature, human presence and noise.
                </p>

                <h5> Disposal </h5>
                <p> Use smart hoppers that use vacuum and suction
                    waste to underground storage, helps reduce the smell of garbage waiting to be collected, and reduces
                    noise
                    pollution from vehicles to collect. It also allows the city to monitor the level
                    waste from different locations and optimize waste collection, which reduces both resources and
                    time,
                    required for this service. Meanwhile, waste incineration is subsequently used for production
                    energy for heating systems
                </p>

                <h5> City Bicycle System </h5>
                <p> At one time, Barcelona was one of the first and largest cities
                    implemented this system. This initiative aims to reduce the number of cars that
                    circulating in the city.
                </p>

                <h5> Bus transport system </h5>
                <p> The bus transport system is distinguished by stable mobility and
                    reducing emissions with hybrid buses. This system also has reasonable shelter for
                    tires that use solar panels to power screens that show the time
                    expectation.
                </p>

                <h5> Noise sensors </h5>
                <p> Plaza de Sol residents, who have been complaining about night noise for decades, have started
                    use inexpensive and easy-to-use sensors to detect contamination
                    air, noise level, humidity and temperature. With their help, residents were able to prove that the
                    level
                    noise was almost 100 decibels, which exceeded WHO recommendations. Armed with this
                    information, residents went to the city council, clicking on them to rethink
                    use of space.
                </p>


                <h5> Irrigation system </h5>
                <p> Various sensors in the ground offer data on humidity, temperature, speed
                    wind, sunlight and atmospheric pressure. This means, for example, that gardeners can decide that
                    plants need to be based on this data and adapt their schedule to avoid oversaturation.
                    It is estimated that the city will recoup its initial investment in the construction of the first
                    phase of the system in one go
                    year, when they will reduce water use by about a quarter.
