                <p> The development of smart cities in Singapore is in line with the National Strategy for Smart
                    the nation of Singapore ”, the main directions of development of which are: digital economy, digital
                    government and
                    digital society. As noted in the strategy, the essence of the digital economy is fast
                    digitalization, which transforms business operations, industry structures and revises the rules in
                    everything
                    the world. Talent and enterprise are critical in the digital economy to support
                    competitiveness. Singapore business environment, quality infrastructure and communication with
                    major Asian economies, as well as investment and well-developed technology
                    will continue to help attract business and talent.
                </p>

                <p> The goal is to build a strong economy that will remain attractive for foreign investment
                    good opportunities for Singaporeans. Digital government involves the use of data, connections and
                    calculations to change the way citizens and businesses are served, as well as the way in which
                    civil servants have the opportunity to fully realize their professional skills and abilities.
                    A digital government that "serves the heart" is one that is able to automate the work where it is
                    perhaps to provide personal contact in a way that enriches the experience of citizens. Goal
                    digital government - integrate services around the needs of citizens and businesses, strengthen
                    integration between
                    policies, operations and technologies, increase the government's digital capacity for implementation
                    innovation and collaboration with citizens and businesses. Singapore is a constant challenge for
                    development
                    that with a limited amount of land, the Singapore government must constantly find innovation
                    solutions to improve the urban environment, homesteads and houses for residents to make them
                    safer, more resilient and viable. </p>

                <h5> SMART PUB </h5>
                <p> Singapore's National Water Agency launched the SMART program in July 2018
                    PUB aimed at digitizing Singapore's entire water system to improve efficiency
                    and the quality of meeting water needs. A roadmap has been developed to digitize
                    Singapore's entire water supply system to improve operational excellence and meet
                    future water needs. The roadmap aims to achieve better quality management
                    water, network improvements, integrated customer commitments and smarter workflows.
                </p>

                <h5> SolarNova </h5>
                <p> Smart Lighting - Lighting equipped with sensors and warning lights
                    software installed in common areas can help HDB
                    understand the structures of human movement and optimize lighting; lighting in common areas with
                    small or undetected human movement can be reduced and will help reduce
                    energy consumption.
                    The SolarNova program provides for accelerating the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems
                    Singapore, and the promotion and aggregate demand for solar photovoltaic installations in government
                    institutions to achieve significant savings, as well as stimulate the growth of the solar industry
                    Singapore.
                </p>

                <h5> Pneumatic waste transportation system </h5>
                <p> Program "Pneumatic Waste Transportation System" - an automated collection system
                    waste, which uses vacuum-type underground pipelines to collect household waste, which
                    then transported through underground pipes to an airtight container. Trucks then
                    periodically collect waste for disposal. The advantages of this program include: reduced
                    the need for manual labor; more comfortable living environment as the system helps to eliminate
                    unpleasant odors emitted from landfills, thus contributing to a more hygienic and more
                    clean environment; environmental friendliness, as the system reduces the need to flush gutters,
                    reduces pest infestation and minimizes waste decomposition; encourage recycling since
                    it supports waste disposal for recycling.
                </p>

                <h5> Real estate transactions HDB </h5>
                <p> Brain-like smart hub for HDB real estate transactions, assembling and integrating
                    numerous sources of information, such as real-time data on the energy used
                    joint services owned by HDB. Data storage helps provide a better understanding of that
                    will promote better urban planning and construction, and help city councils improve
                    real estate management.
                </p>
                <p> "Smart HDB Town Framework" shows how HDB intends to implement a "smart" element in
                    HDB cities and estates, focusing on four key dimensions: smart planning; clever
                    environment; reasonable property; smart lifestyle. Some smart planning technologies
                    include: a tool for modeling complex systems - a decision-making tool that
                    helps planners to understand the trade-offs associated with implementing new stable ones
                    functions in cities. For example, this tool allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of various
                    initiatives
                    (eg LED lighting, solar energy, sky and vertical greenery, harvesting
                    rainwater, disposal, collection of pneumatic waste), as well as make decisions about
                    the best combination to achieve sustainability goals in a cost-effective way. </p>

                <h5> Smart Car Parks </h5>
                <p> Smart Car Parks - each car park will have an intelligent demand monitoring system
                    parking, which will automatically increase the number of available lots during off - peak hours for
                    visitors, as residents with a parking lot of the season do not work. Conversely, it will also reduce
                    the number of available sites for visitors in short-term parking in the evening to provide
                    enough lots for residents who have returned home. Singapore is testing autonomous
                    vehicles, including full-size robotic buses, as well as a monitoring system
                    the elderly to ensure the health and well-being of their senior citizens. Special
                    programs report on buses and taxis, parking spaces and taxis.
                    Sensors measure the density of traffic and automatically solve the problem of traffic lights
                    with traffic lights. Elderly people or people with disabilities
                    using a social card can add time to the green light at crossings.
                </p>

                <p> Some hospitals operate remotely. Doctors can monitor patients
                    using sensors and wireless communication. The city's computer system monitors the power system,
                    the condition of the gas pipeline and water supply and responds quickly to the accident. Waste water
                    is purified and
                    is sent to special vertical skyscrapers that provide vegetarian food
